Memory Card Game
================

Demo <a href='http://jsfiddle.net/bebebebebe/3cvg2/'>here</a>.

JavaScript implementation of the classic memory card game.

You can choose how many cards to use (currently limited by the 81 available patterns, for a maximum of 162 cards), and the cards are dynamically resized to fit in the 350 by 350 pixel board. You can shuffle the cards and reset the board.

The cards are made with HTML5 Canvas.

TO DO:

* Generalize game by allowing n-tuples rather than pairs of each card type.
  
  For example, if you choose triples, when playing you select three cards each turn rather than two.
